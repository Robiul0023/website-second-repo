			<h2>What is team?</h2>
			<p>A team is a group of individuals (human or non-human) 
			working together to achieve their goal.
			As defined by Professor Leigh Thompson of the Kellogg 
			School of Management, "[a] team is a group of people 
			who are interdependent with respect to information,
			resources, knowledge and skills and who seek to 
			combine their efforts to achieve a common goal".[1]
			A group does not necessarily constitute a team. 
           Teams normally have members with complementary 
			skills[2] and generate synergy[3] through a 
			coordinated effort which allows each member to
			 maximize their strengths and minimize their 
			 weaknesses.</p>
			 <p>Naresh Jain (2009) claims:
            Team members need to learn how to help one 
			another, help other team members realize their
			true potential, and create an environment that 
			allows everyone to go beyond their limitations.[4]
			While academic research on teams and teamwork has 
			grown consistently and has shown a sharp increase 
			over the past recent 40 years, the societal diffusion
			of teams and teamwork actually followed a volatile 
			trend in the 20th century.[5] The concept was 
			 introduced into business in the late 20th century, 
			 which was followed by a popularization of the concept
			of constructing teams.</p>
			<p>Differing opinions exist on 
			 the efficacy of this new management fad.[6] Some see
			"team" as a four-letter word: overused and under-useful.[7]
			Others see it as a panacea that realizes the Human 
			Relations Movement's desire to integrate what that
			 movement perceives as best for workers and as best
			for managers.[8]
			Many people believe in the effectiveness of teams, 
			but also see them as dangerous because of the
			potential for exploiting workers — in that team 
			effectiveness can rely on peer pressure and peer
			surveillance.[9] However, Hackman sees team 
		    effectiveness not only in terms of performance:
		   a truly effective team will contribute to the 
			personal well-being and adaptive growth of its 
			members.[10]</p>

			<p>English-speakers commonly use the word "team" 
			in today's society to characterise many types
			of groups. Peter Guy Northouse's book Leadership:
			theory and practice[11] discusses teams from a 
			leadership perspective. According to the team 
			approach to leadership, a team is a type of 
			organizational group of people that are members.
			[citation needed] A team is composed of members 
			who are dependent on each other, work towards 
			interchangeable achievements, and share common
			attainments. A team works as a whole together 
		    to achieve certain things. A team is usually 
		    located in the same setting as it is normally
			connected to a kind of organization, company,
			or community.</p>
			<p>Teams can meet in-person (directly 
			face-to-face) or virtually when practicing their
			values and activities or duties. A team's communication
			is significantly important to their relationship.
			[citation needed] Ergo, communication is frequent 
			 and persistent, and as well are the meetings.
			[citation needed] The definition of team as an 
			organizational group is not completely set in 
			stone, as organizations have confronted a
			 myriad[quantify] of new forms of contemporary 
			collaboration. Teams usually have strong 
			organizational structured platforms and 
			respond quickly and efficiently to challenges
			as they have skills and the capability to do 
			so.[citation needed] An effective organizational 
			team leads to greater productivity, more effective 
			implementation of resources, better decisions and 
			problem-solving, better-quality products/service,
			
			and greater innovation and originality.[citation needed]

			Alongside the concept of a team, compare the more
		    structured/skilled concept of a crew, the advantages 
			of formal and informal partnerships, or the well-defined 
			- but time-limited - existence of task forces.</p>

			<p>A team becomes more than just a collection of people 

			when a strong sense of mutual commitment creates synergy,
		   thus generating performance greater than the sum of the 
		   performance of its individual members.[12]

			Thus teams of game players can form (and re-form) to 
			practise their craft/sport. Transport logistics executives 
			can select teams of horses, dogs, or oxen for the purpose 
			of conveying passengers or goods. </p>
			<h3>Our colloborative effort in the work:</h3>
			<img src="img/teamwork-3.jpg" alt="team work image" />
			<p>We always follow teamwork for achieving more better with 
			together. It is true that 
			teamwork is the best way to utilize different person different
			talent and thinking with
			together in a project to achieving more and more. There is no doubt 
			that teamwork bring better speed in the work and it makes great 
			creation and rythom and also harmony among the team member. For this 
			reason most of the corporat office internally and globally 
			emphasize on teamwork.</p>
			<h2>Analyze of Teamwork:</h2>
			<p>Teamwork is the collaborative effort of a group to achieve 
			a common goal or to complete a task in the most effective and 
			efficient way.[1][2] This concept is seen within the greater 
			framework of a team, which is a group of interdependent 
			individuals who work together towards a common goal.[3] The 
			four key characteristics of a team include a shared goal,
			interdependence, boundedness and stability, the ability to
			manage their own work and internal process, and operate in
			a bigger social system. [4] Basic requirements for effective
			teamwork are an adequate team size. The context is important,
			and team sizes can vary depending upon the objective. A team 
			must include at least 2 or more members, and most teams range 
			in size from 2 to 100. Sports teams generally have fixed sizes
			based upon set rules, and work teams may change in size depending
			upon the phase and complexity of the objective. Teams need to be
			able to leverage resources to be productive (i.e. playing fields
			or meeting spaces, scheduled times for planning, guidance from 
			coaches or supervisors, support from the organization, etc.), 
			and clearly defined roles within the team in order for everyone 
			to have a clear purpose.[5][6][7][8] Teamwork is present in any 
			context where a group of people are working together to achieve 
			a common goal.[1] These contexts include an industrial organization
			(formal work teams), athletics (sports teams), a school (classmates
			working on a project), and the healthcare system (operating room teams).
			In each of these settings, the level of teamwork and interdependence 
			can vary from low (e.g. golf, track and field), to intermediate 
			(e.g. baseball, football), to high (e.g. basketball, soccer), 
			depending on the amount of communication, interaction, and 
			collaboration present between team members. E. g. Team work
			coordinates the work as early as possible</p>
			<p>Teamwork stretches far beyond making the best snow fort or
			carrying the heaviest objects. But not everyone sees the

			<h2>Teamwork background:</h2>
			<img src="img/teamwork-1.jpg" alt="teamwork image" />
			<p>The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of "team-work" 
			in the context of a team of draught animals as early as 1800.[9]

			Even though collaborative work among groups of individuals is
			very prominent today, that was not the case over half a century 
			ago.[timeframe?] The shift from the typical assembly line to 
			organizational models that contained increasing amounts of teamwork
			first came about during World War I and World War II, in an effort
			[by whom?] for countries to unite their people.[citation needed] 
			The movement towards teamwork was mostly due to the Hawthorne 
			studies, a set of studies conducted in the 1920s and 1930s that
			suggested positive aspects of teamwork in an organizational setting.
			After organizations recognized the value of teamwork and the
			positive effects it had on companies, entire fields of work 
			shifted from the typical assembly line to the contemporary High 
			Performance Organizational Model</p>
