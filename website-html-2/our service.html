								<h4>Humanitarian service</h4>
								<img src="img/img-31.jpg" 
								alt="service content image" />
								<p>It is undoubtedly truth that as a social being 
								we have responsibility 
								to other. Moreover, it is common matter that man can
								not live alone in 
								the earth. Because we are not cent person self-reliance.
								In addition, 
								since we are social being then we have to always 
								dependency another person.
								For this reason, our organization always maintain 
								social responsibility 
								to the society.This called CSR(Corporate Social 
								Responsibility). 
								And then, day by day our responsibility are 
								expanding for 
								deprieved people. 
								</p>
								<p>As armed conflicts, mass displacement, and 
								disasters take an
								ever heavier toll, humanitarian intervention remains
								a cornerstone of 
								global governance. Over five decades spent battling
								crises, the World 
								Food Programme (WFP) has accrued vast expertise and
								capacity in supply
								chain, engineering and emergency telecommunications
								– often in the most
								challenging environments.</p>
								<p>Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance
								to people who need help. 
								It is usually short-term help until the long-term help
								by the government and other institutions replaces it.
								Among the people in need are the homeless, refugees, 
								and victims of natural disasters, wars, and famines.
								Humanitarian relief efforts
								are provided for humanitarian purposes and include 
								natural disasters and 
								man-made disasters. The primary objective of 
								humanitarian aid is to save 
								lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity.
								It may, therefore,
								be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to
								address the underlying
								socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis
								or emergency. 
								There is a debate on linking humanitarian aid and 
								development efforts, 
								which was reinforced by the World Humanitarian 
								Summit in 2016. 
								However, the conflation is viewed critically by
								practitioners.</p>

								<p>Humanitarian aid is seen as "a fundamental expression
								of the universal value 
								of solidarity between people and a moral imperative".
								[2] Humanitarian aid 
								can come from either local or international communities.
								In reaching out 
								to international communities, the Office for the 
								Coordination of 
								Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)[3] of the United Nations 
								(UN) is responsible
								for coordination responses to emergencies. It taps to
								the various members 
								of Inter-Agency Standing Committee, whose members are
								responsible for 
								providing emergency relief. The four UN entities that
								have primary 
								roles in delivering humanitarian aid are United 
								Nations Development
								Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Refugee 
								Agency (UNHCR), 
								the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and
								the World Food
								Programme (WFP).[4]
								Humanitarian Aid being distributed in Haiti</p>

								<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross 
								understands humanitarian relief 
								as a norm in both international and non-international
								armed conflicts, 
								and countries or war parties that prevent humanitarian
								relief are 
								generally widely criticized.[5] According to The 
								Overseas Development
								Institute, a London-based research establishment,
								whose findings were 
								released in April 2009 in the paper "Providing aid
								in insecure environments:
								2009 Update", the most lethal year for aid providers
								in the history of
								humanitarianism was 2008, in which 122 aid workers 
								were murdered and 260 
								assaulted. The countries deemed least safe were Somalia
								and Afghanistan.[6]
								In 2014, Humanitarian Outcomes reported that the countries
								with the highest
								incidents were: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the
								Congo, Central 
								African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Pakistan,
								Somalia, 
								Yemen and Kenya.[7]</p>

								<p>According to the Global Humanitarian Overview of OCHA,
								235 million people need
								humanitarian assistance and protection in 2021, or 1 out
								of 33 people worldwide.[8] </p>
								<h4>From Humanitarian to Development Aid</h4>
								<img src="img/img-4.jpg" alt="image for humanitarian" />

								<p> When armed conflict breaks out or natural disasters
								strike, entire 
								 communities
								 are 
								 affected, disrupting their day-to-day lives and long-term
								 development 
								 prospects.
								 Humanitarian aid is designed to save lives and alleviate
								 suffering during
								 and 
								 in the immediate aftermath of emergencies, whereas 
								 development aid responds 
								 to ongoing structural issues, particularly systemic 
								 poverty, that may hinder
								 economic, institutional and social development in 
								 any given society, and 
								 assists in building capacity to ensure resilient 
								 communities and sustainable
								 livelihoods. Both humanitarian and development aid 
								 are related, and 
								 different
								 forms of aid often have both humanitarian and 
								 development components.

								Development aid can exist without humanitarian aid 
								(in developing countries 
								that do not have humanitarian crises), but it also 
								often exists in addition 
								to humanitarian aid during and after crises. For example,
								if an earthquake 
								strikes a country, short-term humanitarian aid is needed.
								This includes the
								 delivery of food and water, the provision of temporary 
								 shelter, as well 
								 as health services.</p>
								 <h4>Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development</h4>
								 <img src="img/img-36.jpg" alt="image for humanitarian" />
								 <p>In 1995, the European Parliament issued a report entitled,
								 Linking
								 Relief, 
								 Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD). This document 
								 looked at aid 
								 effectiveness
								 and the need to engage in relief efforts that reinforce
								 development 
								 objectives, as well as development efforts that prepare
								 communities 
								 to better withstand disasters and emergencies. LRRD 
								 looks to bridge 
								 the crucial gaps between humanitarian and development 
								 aid. At the same 
								 time, it recognizes the need to maintain a degree of 
								 separation between 
								 the two, as each offers its own expertise and comparative
								 advantage.

								One of the main elements of the LRRD concept is that 
								transitioning between
								humanitarian 
								and development programming is a non-linear process. 
								It is a continuous cycle
								where 
								populations are constantly moving from relief to development
								or from development
								to 
								relief in chaotic and unexpected progressions.

								 According to the UN, the majority of the world’s population
								 now lives in 
								 areas affected
								 by natural hazards. It is expected that this proportion 
								 will continue to rise as a
								 growing number of people are residing in seismic, coastal 
								 and other unsafe areas, 
								 often in vast and unplanned urban communities. In 
								 addition, the OECD estimates 
								 that 1.5 billion people live in countries affected by
								 repeated cycles of 
								 violence and insecurity.

								Consequently, disaster risk reduction and risk management
								need to be 
								addressed within 
								development programming to mitigate the devastating 
								consequences of 
								unexpected 
								conflicts and disasters. For its part, humanitarian aid
								should also build 
								the proper foundation to complement long-term development
								objectives 
								(see fact sheet Building Resilience). By avoiding extended
								humanitarian 
								programming, which can build aid dependence, and by 
								addressing root 
								problems in tandem with offering relief, humanitarian aid
								can contribute
								 to the alleviation of cyclical crises.</p>
								 <h4>Good Practices:</h4>
									<img src="img/img-39.jpg" alt="humanitarian image" />
									<p>The LRRD concept also underscores the need to view 
									the transition between
									humanitarian and development aid as a “contiguum” 
									rather than a continuum. 
									Although there was a previous focus on sequencing these
									two types of 
									assistance in a linear fashion, it is now understood 
									that they must be
									done in parallel.

									In light of this, good practices include:

									- Increased dialogue between the two sectors at the
									donor, institutional and 
									country project level, 
									as well as between these levels;

									- Greater awareness of and efforts to break down 
									programmatic silos; and

									- A mutual understanding between the two sectors 
									regarding their distinct 
									identities, values and 
									comparative advantages in order to facilitate an 
									effective integration.</p>
									<h4>Smaller disasters</h4>
									<p>Around the world, disasters occur frequently, 
									more than 350 times a year. Although major emergencies
									are generally well publicized, the majority of disasters
									are local, affect comparatively fewer people and receive
									little media attention.

									But when a woman, man or child survives a disaster 
									-- whether 1,000 or 100,000 
									people are affected -- their basic needs are the same
									and they desperately 
									need our help.

									Thanks to the unique partnership with Global Affairs 
									Canada, the Canadian Humanitarian Assistance Fund (CHAF)
									allows the Humanitarian Coalition to respond quickly to 
									such emergencies. The CHAF makes funds available almost
									immediately, and our members, on the ground in more than
									140 countries, choose the agency among them that is best
									placed to provide aid quickly and effectively.

									Donations to the Humanitarian Coalition outside of an 
									emergency appeal are dedicated to this “disaster-ready”
									fund.

									Smaller disasters are supported by Global Affairs Canada
									(85%), 
									the Humanitarian Coalition (5%) and the Humanitarian 
									Coalition’s member agencies (10%),
                                    meaning that every $1 given to the Humanitarian Coalition
									is multiplied to provide $20 
									in life-saving aid.</p>
									<h4>Major emergencies:</h4>
									<p>When a major emergency strikes, the Humanitarian 
									Coalition leads its members in a joint appeal 
									– a united effort to inform Canadians and raise funds
									quickly and transparently, so that the most aid can be
									delivered to survivors in the shortest time.

									We rely on our corporate and media partners and supporters
									to disseminate 
									the message widely and rapidly.
									We often receive government support through a matching fund. 

									Together, we make donating simple for Canadians by 
									removing competition for donations, 
									increasing the awareness of needs and reducing 
									the duplication of costs,
									 meaning more help for survivors.</p>
									 <h4>How we allocate your donations:</h4>
									 <p>Our priority is to get help to those in need as 
									 quickly and 
									 efficiently as possible.Thanks to the generosity of 
									 Canadians,
									 distribute.
									 Humanitarian coordination involves bringing together
									 humanitarian. who are Humanitarian they always keeps 
									 better contribution for everbody.There is no doubt 
									 that as a social being we everybody have to be 
									 humanitarian.Because we are not self-reliance person.
									 So we have to be sacrifice our time and money and 
									 wealth for other. It is undoubtedly true that if we 
									 want to be  happy then we have to be humanitarian
									 for all being in the earth.
									 It is true that who are humanitarian they are
									 sympathetic man. In addition there is no doubt that
									 humanitarian person all keeps important contribution
									 for human society. It is true that all humanitarian 
									 man are well healthy family life lead in the world 
									 community.There is no doubt that humanitarian person
									 are helpful for.</p>

									<p>Now at present world technology is the essential part
									of human life. Without technology human life is quite 
									impossible. In addition, it is absolutely truth that 
									technology is made easy and comfortable of human life.
									Moreover, we everybody known 
									that which countries are developed these are using modern 
									technology and they also encourage learn and practice modern 
									technology. It is common matter that which countries are 
									least developed country, these are backward in technology
									sector. 
									They do not know how  to proper use  technology. For this 
									reason, we are continuing our technology service for 
									deprived peoples. There is no doubt that using more 
									technology ensure socio-conomic development in any nation.
									Moreover, it is sure that technology is made not only  easy 
									and comfortable human life, 
									but also it helps to build free from corruption
									country and 
									also society.</p>
									<p>It is common matter that technology is efffective
									tools 
									for being development for all
									backward country. It is also truth that there 
									are equal reaction 
									of every action. 
									This truth is same applicable in technology.
									It is  undoubtedly truth that there are both side of 
									using technology. 
									Such as positive and negative. But, as a human
									being we 
									have to  deeply consider our knowledge to 
									use technology so that human being is benefitted
									throug 
									the proper using of technology. 
									In 2000, we helped start Technology For All-Colorado
									which 
									has become the Community Computer Connection.
									C3-Home 
									(c3-colorado.org). It was initially funded by
									Jared Polis,
									now governor of Colorado.</p>

									<p>In 2005, we received a $650,000 grant from
									the U. S. 
									Department of Commerce Technology Opportunity 
									Program to 
									create jobs as a part of a scanning business. 
									For
									a time,
									20 persons were trained and employed in Houston’s
									East End. 
									The Technology Opportunities Program (doc.gov)

									In 2010, we received a $9.6 million grant from the
									Broadband 
									Technology Opportunities program that was matched 
									by over $8.2
									million in private investments. With those resources
									from 
									2010-2014 we created and staffed 96 public computer
									centers 
									across Texas that provided 3.7 million hours of basic
									computer
									skills training to 2.3 million persons Technology 
									for All, Inc.
									| BroadbandUSA - NTIA (doc.gov)</p>

									<p>Additionally, TFA has developed a National Science
									Foundation research
									relationship with Rice University. Since 2005, 
									through a series of
									NSF funded projects we have built a public wireless
									network in 
									the neighborhood around us that provides a research
									platform for
									Rice. For more information see the links below. 
									Technology for 
									All | Advancing Technology, Serving the Underserved
									(rice.edu)

									Today, TFA works with its partners to discover 
									new ways to use 
									technology as a tool to empower low-income and 
									underserved 
									communities. Over the years the tools may have 
									changed, but 
									the needs may be even more acute as underserved

									<h4>What Is Equitable Access to Technology?</h4>
										<img src="img/img-38.jpg" alt="image for technology" />
									<p>The commercialization of electronic devices may
									seem ubiquitous, 
									but not all students have access to them at home. 
									Digital access measures the level of participation
									of students in using 
									digital tools (including both hardware devices 
									and software programs).

									 Equitable access to technology refers to all 
									 students having access to
									 technology and information regardless of their
									 ethnicity, 
									 socio-economic status, age, physical ability,
									 or any other quality. It’s not only integral 
									 for opportunities
									 to learn, but also a fundamental component in
									 assisting students 
									 with acquiring the knowledge and skills they 
									 need to become digitally savvy
									 citizens.</p>

									<p>A lack of equitable access to technology 
									and information 
									deprives students of learning experiences and 
									can
									even 
									limit their opportunities after graduation. 
									This inequity is further exacerbated by the need
									for distance learning this 
									school year.

									Access to technology is more than just providing
									devices and connectivity 
									to students. 
									It also involves making sure every student 
									has the opportunity to learn from a teacher who
									understands how to use 
									technology.
									Why Does Equitable Access to Technology Matter?

									Many students lack access to technology at home.
									Some only have access to a smartphone and no data plan, 
									while others have multiple devices and internet access.
									This disparity in digital access has been called 
									“the homework gap” 
									by policymakers.</p>

									<p>A student’s socio-economic status impacts how 
									likely they are to 
									have access to technology.
									A survey by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan
									American 
									think-tank,
									found that 35 percent of households in the United
									States with 
									school-age children 
									and an annual income of under $30,000 do not have
									access to 
									high-speed internet. 
									Among households earning $75,000 or more,
									only 6 percent lack high-speed internet.

									The National Center for Education Statistics conducted a 
									survey that found only 61 percent of school-aged children
									had 
									internet access at home, 
									and yet a majority of students reported requiring 
									the 
									internet 
									to complete assignments.</p>

									 <p>Educators are well aware of the homework gap and
									 how
									 important it
									 is for students to have equitable access to technology. 
									 Yet much more could be done. A recent infrastructure
									 survey 
									 from the Consortium of School Networking, an association 
									 and advocacy group that promotes emerging technologies 
									 with decision-makers in K-12 education, found that less 
									 than 10 percent of school district leaders felt that 100
									 percent of their students had access to technology outside 
									 of school.

									Technology access is becoming a Catch-22 for students. 
									Increasingly, schools and school districts are promoting
									the use of digital tools for assignments, especially with 
									part of the 2020-2021 school year moving to online learning.
									However, students may not be able to get access to the 
									technology required while at home. </p>
									<p>We support women on maternity leave and when they 
									return,
									 so that they can resume their careers, because being a 
									 parent
									 should not be a career ending choice. And to be blunt; 
									 women
									 need role models in the tech sphere. They need to feel
									 that 
									 they can shape the world of the future and be part of
									 the 
									 conversation.

									Technology, I firmly believe, must work for everyone,
									and
									 must represent the requirements and desires of us of
									 all.
									 Women need to be an integral part of our shared 
									 technological 
									 progress. This is why it’s important that stories like 
									 that of
									 Ms He are heard and shared.</p>

									<p>The barriers to women accessing and having careers in
									the tech 
									industry must be broken down. This needs to start at the
									grass 
									roots level, through education and training, giving girls
									and 
									young women the opportunities and skills to enter the 
									tech world.

									 Sometimes the fight for equality starts way before 
									 entering the
									 professional world. It starts in schools and colleges
									 and on 
									 social media, when our daughters and sons get their first 
									 mobile phones.</p>
									<p>It’s as simple as this: our daughters, just like our sons,
									 need to feel that they can be a part of this new tech world, 
									 not just consumers of it. I believe that if we are to truly 
									 leave no one behind in this fourth industrial revolution,
									 then women must be at the forefront.

									 Our industry has a long way to go in bringing true 
									 equality to 
									 the tech sector, but Huawei will play its part in trying
									 to encourage
									 and inspire young girls and women to become scientists, 
									 tech experts,
									 innovators and leaders of the digital age. A journey of
									 a thousand 
									 miles begins with a single step.</p>
									<h4>Earning Trust: How Businesses Can Build A Positive Brand
									Reputation</h4>
									<img src="img/img-35.jpg" alt="service image" />

									<p>When you are growing your business, 
									 building a positive brand reputation for your company is so
									 important.
									 Customers want to interact with brands that are active in 
									 their community,
									 kind to both customers and employees and are known for 
									 their personality 
									 and relatability. 
									 How can you build a positive brand reputation for your 
									 business?
									 Read on to find out.</p>

									 <p>Great customer service is always important for any 
									 company, 
									 especially if you are trying to build a positive brand
									 reputation.
									 Treating your clients well and listening to
									 their feedback is absolutely vital in building a loyal
									 audience, 
									 and a good customer service interaction goes a long way.
									 People are 
									 likely to share stories of great customer service 
									 experiences and 
									 recommend your company to friends and family,
								     boosting your brand and potentially directing new 
									 customers to you.</p>

									 <p>Build trust between yourself and your customers 
									 and keep any promises 
									 you make. 
									 For example, if you are offering 24-hour delivery, make
									 sure that is 
									 achievable for all customers, 
									 as every single late delivery will massively hurt your
									 brand trust 
									 and reputation.
									 Customers will leave reviews, particularly about bad 
									 experiences or 
									 broken trust,
									 so try to reduce these instances as much as possible. 
									 Most customers who are considering purchasing from a 
									 new company will 
									 first look at reviews online,
									 so having great customer experiences is essential to 
									 improve your 
									 reputation and draw in new customers.</p>

									<p>Occasionally, these bad reviews might come along 
									anyway. When there
									 are problems that arise, 
									don’t bury your head in the sand. Take action and take
									responsibility. 
									Make it up to customers where you can, and hear them out. 
									Be calm and fair when interacting with customers lodging
									complaints of 
									any kind.

									On a similar note, customers like brands that are 
									trustworthy and human. 
									Presenting a human attitude, rather than putting on 
									a cold business front
									can really make customers warm to you, 
									and relate a lot more. Be friendly and genuine in all
									customer interactions
									including marketing and advertisements.
									Social media is a great place to show the individuality
									of not just 
								    your brand but also your staff. 
									Sharing personal experiences and using humour and honesty
									to reach 
									your customers is 
									a great way to improve your likeability.</p>

									<p>Your social media pages are the perfect place to 
									really try this out, 
									with more and more of daily life existing online now, 
									a great digital marketing 
									strategy is essential.
									Post regular updates, but don’t be robotic.
									Create fun and relatable campaigns, and monitor your 
									social media pages regularly.
									Encourage customers to interact and send you any feedback,
									which should be checked often to increase response times, 
									which in turn increases trust.

									Ensure your staff have a strong product knowledge and 
									are well-trained on 
									everything they are selling. 
									The importance of product knowledge should never be 
									underestimated. 
									It not only allows your employees to sell your product 
									or service much more
									 easily and naturally, 
									but customers tend to respond positively to staff who
									 are enthusiastic 
									and knowledgeable about the product they are selling.
									 They can better 
									explain and advertise a product, and enthusiasm from 
									staff will have 
									an extremely positive effect on customers.</p>

									<p>As well as training your staff, make sure to treat 
									them really well. 
									Being a good employer is essential if you are trying
									 to build a positive brand reputation, 
									especially with the rise in popularity of sites such 
									as glassdoor, 
									where employees can rate and review employers.
									Make sure you treat your employees well so that 
									 will encourage friends and other industry professionals
									 to work for you. 
									

									Be part of the community

									Wherever you can, 
									take opportunities to help to grow and expand your community 
									and the wider industry. 
									This will help to improve your reputation amongst your peers.
									 Get involved in community projects,
									make sure to set up a presence on professional networks such
									 as LinkedIn and attend
									networking and industry events to share your expertise and 
									connect with like-minded people.</p>

									<p>Similarly, get involved with your local community and 
									donate
									 to charities and projects 
									that are important to you. This will not only help you to 
									reach new audiences 
									but can be a marker to potential customers of how much you 
									care.

								<h4>News for world</h4>
								<img src="img/img-5.jpg" alt="service image" />
								<p>It is very interesting matter that world news helps us always
								to know different types of information from country to country 
								different sector situation. For example: economic, education, 
								technology and culture , business and sports and also 
								political situation.
								There is no doubt that as a human being we have to 
								communication to other.</p>
								
								<p>World news or international news or even foreign 
								coverage is
								the news media jargon for news from abroad, about a
								country or a 
								global subject. For journalism, it is a branch that 
								deals with news
								either sent by foreign correspondents or news agencies, 
								or – more
								recently – information that is gathered or researched
								through 
								distance communication technologies, such as telephone, 
								satellite
								TV or the internet.</p>

								<p>Although in most of the English-speaking world this 
								field is not
								usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, 
								it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United 
								States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and 
								"national" news when they include directly the national 
								government or national institutions, such as wars in which 
								the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations 
								in which the US are a member.

								At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign,
								as registered by the courants of the 17th century in West 
								and Central Europe, such as the Daily Courant (England), 
								the Nieuwe Tijudinger (Antwerp), the Relation (Strasbourg),
								the Avisa Relation oder Zeitung (Wolfenbüttel) and the 
								Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland & C. (Amsterdam). Since
								these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they 
								brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant 
								other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that 
								nation-states were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

								From the 19th century on, with newspapers already 
								established in 
								Europe, the United States and a few other countries, 
								innovations 
								in telecommunications such as the telegraph made news
								from abroad
								easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then 
								founded, 
								like AFP (France), Reuters (UK), Wolff (currently DPA,
								Germany) 
								and the AP (US).

								War journalism is one of the best known subfields of 
								world news 
								(although war coverage can be national for the media of 
								belligerent countries themselves). </p>
								<h4>Different types news reporter.</h4>
								<img src="img/img-37.jpg" alt="image for news" />
								<p>A correspondent is a reporter who contributes news or
								commentary 
								to a publication or media network, often from a distant
								location. 
								Foreign correspondents typically report from countries other than
								their own and focus on specific “beats” (e.g., the drug trade 
								in Southeast Asia or politics in Africa). A foreign correspondent
								can be “roving” — following news events or topics of interest 
								wherever the stories take them.

								If you’re excited by the prospect of trekking the globe to uncover 
								and report on important news, you’ll need some essential skills. 
								First and foremost, a foreign correspondent needs to be 
								a subject-matter
								expert in the field in which they report; translating their broad 
								understanding and specific insights in a way that makes sense to 
								a lay audience. Strong storytelling relies on excellent 
								communication 
								skills, and that often means breaking down complex
								topics into clear 
								and compelling reporting.

								Foreign correspondents have different specialties.
								War correspondents
								report on the quickly evolving circumstances of 
								war in places like 
								Syria. Political news correspondents, like NPR’s 
								Lucian Kim in Russia,
								report on evolving politics and tensions across 
								the globe. Correspondents
								like Chika Oudah combine the stories of citizens
								of faraway countries
								with coverage of political and social issues.

								Foreign correspondents often report for a large media network,
								but they can also be freelance workers, pitching story ideas to 
								a variety of different media outlets. Some foreign correspondents 
								work in media-friendly countries with access to those in power, 
								while others are challenged by assignments in areas of the 
								world considerably less friendly to journalists.

								What a foreign correspondent does is important. If you pursue
								this career, you take on the responsibility of representing
								political events and social movements in cultures other than
								your own in a respectful, accurate, and objective manner. 
								This kind of reporting enables your audience to better 
								understand what’s happening globally. It may even spur 
								them to take action to make the world better.
								Steps to Become a Foreign Correspondent

								If the challenge of illuminating people about world events 
								inspires you, education and training are crucial to success 
								in this exciting but competitive field. When considering how
								to become a foreign correspondent, there are a few essential steps.
								Obtain the Right Education

								A Bachelor of Arts in International Studies from an accredited 
								institution such as Maryville University provides a solid 
								foundation 
								for understanding the complexities of other regions and cultures.
								Many international studies programs allow you to specialize, 
								focusing on one area of interest such as a region of the world,
								or a certain language or culture. You can also focus on a 
								specific topic, like global economics or politics. 
								An international studies degree is not only helpful 
								in gaining a deeper understanding of global and cultural
								issues, but also in helping hone vital communication skills.
								Jump Into a Foreign Environment

								It’s worth supplementing your education with real-world 
								experiences 
								in a foreign environment. This can happen through a 
								study abroad program,
								either while earning your degree or after graduation. 
								Taking the time to 
								immerse yourself in a foreign culture allows you to adapt to
								new experiences, gain more intercultural skills, and 
								learn a new language.

								While studying abroad, students are able to continue 
								sharpening their
								communication skills and expand their understanding of 
								global issues 
								during formal study. They can then apply their classroom 
								skills to 
								their work in international settings. Students aspiring
								to become foreign 
								correspondents might do well to study journalism during 
								their study 
								abroad to experience the realities of reporting from 
								another country.
								Foreign Correspondent Salaries

								The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) includes foreign 
								correspondents among the category of reporters, correspondents,
								and broadcast news analysts. Within that group, it reported in 
								2018 that the median salary for reporters and correspondents was 
								approximately $41,000. The median salary for broadcast news
								analysts was over $66,000.

								Writing ability is important for foreign correspondents. 
								Courses in international studies such as world literature 
								help students become more effective writers and communicators. 
								In addition, those who are comfortable reporting in front of 
								a camera or microphone via television, radio, podcasts, 
								YouTube videos, or other media outlets may see an increase
								in their market value.

								The lowest 10% of earners in the category of reporters, 
								correspondents, and broadcast news analysts made under $23,490,
								according to the BLS, while the top 10% earned more than $200,180.
								PayScale, which sources its data directly from workers, 
								reports the median salary for foreign correspondents at $60,000.
								Employment Outlook for Foreign Correspondents

								When considering how to become a foreign correspondent, remember 
								the job market for journalists is competitive. This is
								partly because
								numerous once-large media outlets are shifting to a 
								contracting model
								for their reporting, merging, or shutting down. While 
								the average 
								large American broadsheet newspaper used to have 
								numerous foreign
								correspondents, 
								now only a handful of national papers do.

								The BLS projects that between 2016 and 2026, the market for
								broadcast news analysts will remain steady, while the number
								of reporting and correspondent 
								jobs will dip only slightly.

								Not only that, the BLS projects a growth of 6% for 
								writers in the
								field of media and communication. Studying intercultural
								communication
								and taking 
								courses in literature offered in an international studies degree 
								program can help boost future 
								foreign correspondents’ abilities in this field.

								Many of today’s journalists are freelancers with greater
								control over 
								their own content and an ability to forge their own
								relationships with
								various news outlets.
								Today, whatever the arena, opportunities exist for
								candidates who are 
								motivated, hardworking, and able to navigate the 
								changing dynamics of 
								the foreign news market.

								<p>News Gathering with New Technology

								Technology innovations have changed the ways foreign 
								news is gathered 
								and disseminated and the way people receive the news.
								In earlier times,
								 a foreign correspondent was a resident in a foreign 
								 land who sent letters
								 or reports carried home by ship or by mail. Recently 
								 computer technology 
								 and satellites have meant that the flow of news from 
								 abroad into news 
								 organizations has increased exponentially. Foreign 
								 correspondents now 
								 use laptop computers connected by modems to phone lines
								 (also by wireless
								 means) 
								 to get their stories out—whether from a golf match, 
								 a court trial,
								 or a foreign civil war. Foreign correspondents are no 
								 longer isolated,
								 but are in daily communication with their editors
								 and other reporters 
								 by Internet or cell phones. This has given overseas
								 news an immediacy it
								 never had before.

								For television reporting from abroad, a major advance
								was the highly 
								portable satellite uplinks, which can be disassembled
								and flown to the 
								site of a major story in order to feed back live 
								reports via satellite.
								 This kind of “flyaway” dish can become a temporary
								 CNN or ABC bureau in
								 just the time it takes to get one on the scene.


								 affecting daily journalism has been facsimile 
								 production and distribution
								 of national and international newspapers.Another 
								 use of satellites affecting 
								 daily journalism . It is undoubtedly true that 
								 journalism is the great profession.
								 It helps to remove corruption from the society 
								 and the country. 
								 In addition, most of the democratic country in 
								 the world always 
								 follow democratic governance rules and regulation 
								 for good governance 
								 education and all over country social development.</p>
								 <p>n a complex, fast-paced world of soundbites,
								 knee-jerk opinions 
								 and information overload, BBC Future provides 
								 something different: 
								 a home for slowing down, delving deep and 
								 shifting perspectives.
