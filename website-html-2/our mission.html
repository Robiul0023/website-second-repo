						  <h2>How to define mission:</h2>
						  <p>A mission statement is used by a company to explain, 
						  in simple and concise terms, its purpose(s) for being. 
						  The statement is generally short, either 
						  a single sentence or a short paragraph. </p>
							<ul class="define"> 
							<h3>To the point:</h3>
							<li>A mission statement is used by a company to explain, 
							in simple and concise terms, its purpose(s) for being.</li>
							<li>t is usually one sentence or a short paragraph, explaining 
							a company's culture, values, and ethics.</li>
							<li>Mission statements serve several purposes, including 
							motivating employees and 
							reassuring investors of the company's future.</li>
							<li>To craft a mission statement, consider how your company 
							impacts customers, donors, investors, 
							or your community and why you strive to help these parties.</li>
							<li>A mission statement might slightly overlap other 
							marketing content, 
							but it is different from a vision 
							statement, value statement, brand, or slogan</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Mission Statements:</h3>
														
							<p>Technology companies help our society move into the future. 
							The paths of these companies is difficult, 
							so a mission statement is necessary to help navigate the way.

							Computer Hardware/Equipment

							You’ve enhanced your company’s survivability in the face of 
							Moore’s law.
							Now communicate and define your goals to your customers and 
							employees.


							Semiconductors

							Scan these chip makers’ mission statements to see how 
							they are accelerating their brand.


							Mobile/Wireless

							You enable massive productivity increases by untethering your 
							user’s lives.


							Ad and Marketing Software

							Reach out to your audience and the stakeholders in your 
							advertising/marketing software business with a great
							mission statement.


							Customer Relationship Management

							Clients should feel like kings! Mission statements should
							make your CRM software business stakeholders 
							work toward this goal.</p>
							
							<h3>How to a Mission Statement Works:</h3>
							<p>Mission statements serve a dual purpose by helping employees 
							remain focused on the tasks at hand, and encouraging them to find
							innovative ways of moving toward increasing 
							their productivity with the eye to achieving company goals. </p>
							<p>A company’s mission statement defines its culture, values, 
							ethics, fundamental goals, and agenda. Furthermore, 
							it defines how each of these applies to the company's 
							stakeholders—its employees, distributors, suppliers, 
							shareholders, and the community at large. 
							These entities can use this statement to align their 
							goals with that of the company. </p>
							<p>The statement reveals what the company does, how it does it, 
							and why it does it. Prospective investors may also refer to the 
							mission statement to see if the values of the company align with 
							theirs. For example, an ethical investor against tobacco 
							products would probably not invest in a company 
							whose mission is to be the largest global manufacturer of
							cigarettes.</p>
							<p>It is not uncommon for large companies to spend 
							many years and 
							millions of dollars to develop and refine their mission
							statements. 
							In some cases, mission statements eventually become
							household 
							phrases. </p>
						  
						  <h3>Our mission:</h3>
						  <img src="img/mission.jpg" alt="mission image" />
						  <p>It is ensure that as a social being we have different types 
						  of mission for development our socio-economic condition. 
						  In addition, it is absolutely truth that we have taken every 
						  decision for generating our busineess revenue.But as 
						  social being we think that we have liability for the society. 
						  For this reason we have some mission plan for the people and 
						  our organization development.</p>
						  

						  <p>Our mission is simple: make technology an asset for your business 
						  not a problem. 
						  Too many times we have seen other IT consulting firms recommend 
						  solutions that 
						  are not appropriate for the specific client’s business or will not take 
						  a business’
						  operations into their planning as they routinely bring down an entire 
						  business 
						  while they perform routine maintenance on a server. That is 
						  unacceptable.
						  We won’t bring you down in the middle of the day because it is 
						  “a better time for us”.
						  We work around your business. We strive to make technology integrate
						  seamlessly with 
						  your business so your business can grow. As your technology partner, 
						  when your business
						  grows ours will grow with you, 
						  therefore, we will work hand in hand with you to support your growth.</p>
						  
						  
						  <h4>Mission for start new journey</h4>
						  <p>It is true that we have to go ahead to our destination. 
						  We have new plan for making new society. There is no doubt that 
						  our every step we count as a new journey.</p>
						  <h4>Mission for preparation new dreams</h4>
						  <p>We are new dreams for preparation new project. 
						  We always maintain our work standard,</p>
						  <h4>Mission for commitment:</h4>
						  <p>There is no doubt that commitment always important 
						  part of business growth
